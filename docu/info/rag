I'll add a file upload UI to the frontend homepage and connect the chat to use the RAG backend for context-aware responses.

Now I have a good understanding of the current code. The `api.rs` already has `upload_document` and `search` functions. Let me create an updated `home.rs` that:

1. Adds a file upload UI (sidebar or modal)
2. Integrates RAG search to provide context to the LLM

Now I need to add the required imports. Let me check if `wasm_bindgen_futures` and `js_sys` are properly imported:

I need to add `HtmlInputElement`, `FileList`, and `File` features to web-sys for the file upload to work:

Now I need to add the `wasm_bindgen::JsCast` import to the home.rs file:

Now let's verify the build works by checking if there are any obvious issues. Let me also check if the `SearchResult` is used (it's imported but might not be needed directly):

Now let's try to build the frontend to check for any errors:

The build succeeded with only warnings (no errors). Let me fix the minor warnings in home.rs:

Now let's rebuild the CSS to make sure all styles are included:

Everything is built. Now let me kill the old dx server and restart it so the changes take effect:

The process is already gone. Let me check if there's another dx process running:

There's a dx process running (PID 130784). The dev server is already running and should have hot-reloaded the changes. 

**The frontend is ready!** Just refresh your browser at `http://localhost:1789`.

## Summary of Changes:

### 1. **File Upload UI** (Left Sidebar)
- Click the 📁 button in the header to toggle the documents panel
- Upload `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files
- View list of uploaded documents
- Delete documents
- Reindex all documents with one click

### 2. **RAG Integration**
- Toggle RAG on/off with the switch in the header
- When RAG is ON:
  - Your question is first searched against uploaded documents
  - Top 3 relevant chunks are added as context to the prompt
  - The LLM answers using both the context and its knowledge
- When RAG is OFF:
  - Questions go directly to Ollama without document context

### 3. **Status Indicators**
- Shows document count when RAG is enabled
- Status bar shows "RAG: ON" or "RAG: OFF"
- Upload status messages (success/error)

**Make sure your backend is running on port 3010** for the document upload and RAG search to work:
```bash
cd ~/ag/backend
cargo run
```
